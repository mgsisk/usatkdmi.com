    Taekwondo is a unique combination of techniques, including the quick,
    straight-lined movements typical of Japanese martial arts and the flowing,
    circular movements of many Chinese styles. Both sport and art, taekwondo can
    be enjoyed by everyone both casually and competitively. It's a great way to
    get fit, stay fit, and learn discipline.
