Established in 1994, USA Tae Kwon Do has been Kalamazoo's premier [taekwondo][]
dojang for nearly thirty years. Grand Master M'Hammed Bouabdellaoui (8th Dan,
[World Taekwondo][]) is an [ISSA-certified][] personal trainer,
[Michigan State University][] Hall of Fame Inductee, and president of [Michigan
Sport Taekwondo][] dedicated to helping others gain confidence, discipline, and
health. Grand Master M'Hammed understands that completing goals through
commitment is important to ones inner personal success in life. With an emphasis
on family, honor, and hard work, USA Tae Kwon Do specializes in helping
students of all ages and ability levels achieve their personal fitness goals.
Our mission is to teach honor, discipline, and respect while learning the art of
taekwondo, kickboxing, and self-defense.

Don't take our word for it, though; here are what others have to say.
