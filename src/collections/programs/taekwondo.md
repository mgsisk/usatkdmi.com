Taekwondo is a unique combination of techniques, including the quick,
straight-lined movements typical of Japanese martial arts and the flowing,
circular movements of many Chinese styles. Both sport and art, taekwondo can be
enjoyed by everyone both casually and competitively. It's a great way to get
fit, stay fit, and learn discipline.
