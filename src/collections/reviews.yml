    There truly are not enough words or right words to describe my highest
    recommendation of USA Tae Kwon Do. My family started with Grand Master
    M'Hammed backing the mid 1990s. The dedication and commitment he has for all
    of his students is of the highest degree. My youngest son will still stop in
    to just visit with him when he is visiting from out of state still today. I
    am beyond grateful to have made the commitment to return after stopping in
    the late 1990s... I wish so much I has stuck with it. Ready to obtain my
    Black Belt!!

    I love this school and everyone associated with it, I walked in on day one
    and everyone welcomed me with open arms and Grand Master M'Hammed and Master
    Sue treated me nothing short of a son. I have nothing but great things to
    say about them.

    This is by far one of the best places to come. Our son started practicing at
    5 and took a 4 year break at 10. Its only been 3 months and he has learned
    so much more! I definitely would recommend to anyone.

    Grand Master M'Hammed is the Real Deal. I am familiar with many Taekwondo /
    Martial Arts Schools and Master Instructors. Grand Master M'Hammed is
    definitely at the top of my list. I highly recommend this dojang and this
    teacher.
