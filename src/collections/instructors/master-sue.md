Master Susan Shannon started her journey in taekwondo in 2004. She has had
the privilege to teach and to be continually learning at the same time
during her time in taekwondo. Master Sue has seen many kids grow up at USA
Tae Kwon Do and come back later to check in and let the school know how they
are doing.

The discipline of taekwondo carries you throughout your life, giving you
direction and the camaraderie of being a part of a group of like-minded
people. Master Sue appreciates being part of an international sport that
exposes everyone to many cultures, supporting our commonalities and our
differences.
